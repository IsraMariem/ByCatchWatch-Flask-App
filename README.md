# ByCatch Flask App

## Description
This is a Flask application designed to analyze bycatch data, provide gear recommendations, and visualize the results using various charts and graphs.

## Features
- **Bycatch Data Analysis**: Analyze bycatch data to identify trends and patterns.
- **Gear Recommendation**: Recommend fishing gear based on species and region to minimize bycatch.
- **Clustering**: Group species into clusters using K-Means clustering for better insights.
- **Visualization**: Generate scatter plots and Elbow Method plots for clustering results.
- **API Documentation**: Detailed API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI specifications.
- **Docker Support**: Containerized for easy deployment using Docker.

## Changes Made
- Initial commit with app structure.
- Added functionality for bycatch data processing.
- Integrated chart visualization for bycatch statistics.
